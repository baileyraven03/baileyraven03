### Aerospace & Software

An undergraduate MEng Aerosapce Engineering student @ The University of Sheffield (South Yorkshire, UK), with a specialisation in avionic systems. 
I have an desire to develop my software skills both for 'work' and for personal use, hense this profile.  
I use MatLab (w/ Simulink) & C regularly as apart of my systems and electrical engineering, so there may be scripts here. 
These could include:  
--> Strucural Analysis of Airframes  
--> Power Circuit Design and Analysis   
--> Signal Processing and Visualisation  
--> Control System Design  

Along with this, I am also looking to develop my machine learning skills. I'm doing this using courses on Codecademy and Kaggle. Keep up to date here where I will (hopefully) post more complex models as time goes on.

Would I like this to be a career avenue? Potentially  
Would I like to be profficent enough to show off to people? Absolutely
