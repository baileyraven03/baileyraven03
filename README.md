### Aerospace & Software

An undergraduate MEng Aerosapce Engineering student @ The University of Sheffield (South Yorkshire, UK), with a specialisation in avionic systems.  
I use MatLab (with Simulink) & C regularly as apart of my degree, so there may be scripts here. 
These could include:    
--> Power Circuit Design and Analysis   
--> Signal Processing, Modulation & Demodulation  
--> Controller Design and System analysis

Along with this, I am developing my machine learning skills, using both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
I'm doing this using courses on Codecademy and Kaggle. Keep up to date here where I will (hopefully) post more complex models as time goes on.

Proficient with:
Pyhton3, C & Matlab (Simulink) 

Experienced with:
HTML5, CSS3, SQL, JavaScript & C++

Would I like this to be a career avenue? Potentially  
Would I like to be profficent enough to show off to people? Absolutely
